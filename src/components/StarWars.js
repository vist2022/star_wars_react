                released in 1999. It was directed
                by George Lucas and is the first installment in the «Star Wars» prequel trilogy.

                The film is set in a galaxy far, far away and follows the story of a young Jedi knight named Obi-Wan
                Kenobi and his mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn, as they try to prevent a war between the Galactic Republic and the
                Trade Federation.

                As the story begins, the Trade Federation is blockading the planet Naboo in an effort to force the
                Republic to sign a treaty that would give them more power. In response, the Republic sends two Jedi
                knights, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, to negotiate with the Trade Federation.

                However, the negotiations break down and the Jedi are forced to flee Naboo, taking with them the
                planet’s young queen, Padmé Amidala. As they try to escape, they encounter a young boy named Anakin
                Skywalker, who Qui-Gon believes is the chosen one prophesied to bring balance to the force.

                Together, the Jedi, Padmé, and Anakin try to find a way to stop the war and prevent the Trade Federation
                from taking over the Republic. Along the way, they encounter a number of challenges and enemies,
                including the Sith Lord Darth Maul, who is working for the Trade Federation.

                In the end, the Jedi and their allies are able to defeat the Trade Federation and prevent the war, but
                Qui-Gon is killed in the process. The film ends with Anakin being accepted into the Jedi Order, setting
                the stage for the rest of the prequel trilogy.

                «The Phantom Menace» was a commercial success and it spawned two sequels, «Attack of the Clones» and
                «Revenge of the Sith.» It was followed by a trilogy of sequels, beginning with «The Force Awakens,»
                released in 2015.</p>
