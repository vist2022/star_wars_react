                Originally a farmer on Tatooine living with his uncle and aunt, Luke becomes a pivotal figure in the
                Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Galactic Empire. The son of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker
                (turned Sith Lord Darth Vader) and Padmé Amidala, Luke is the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess
                Leia and eventual brother-in-law of the smuggler Han Solo. Luke trains to be a Jedi under Jedi Masters
                Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda and rebuilds the Jedi Order. He later trains his nephew Ben Solo and mentors
                Rey. Though Luke dies at the end of The Last Jedi, he returns as a Force spirit in The Rise of
                Skywalker, encouraging Rey to face her grandfather, the resurrected Emperor Palpatine. At the end of the
                film, the spirits of Luke and Leia give Rey their blessing to adopt the Skywalker surname and continue
                their family's legacy.

                The character also briefly appears in the prequel film Episode III – Revenge of the Sith as an infant,
                portrayed by Aidan Barton, and in the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi as a child, portrayed by Grant
                Feely. In the de-canonized Star Wars Expanded Universe (renamed Legends), Luke is a main character in
                many stories set after Return of the Jedi, which depict him as a powerful Jedi Master, the husband of
                Mara Jade, father of Ben Skywalker, and maternal uncle of Jaina, Jacen and Anakin Solo.
